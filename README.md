String-Int-Conversions
======================
strgen.c and intgen.c do basically the same thing as each other. They generate some number of random 
numbers (from -25000 to 25000 or so), and write them out to a file. 
Args: <outFile> <total numbers generated> <random number seed>
(by changing the random number seed, you can put a different set of randomly-generated numbers into the file)

strcat.c and intcat.c are smaller versions of the Linux command cat.  With input of the files generated
by strgen.c and intgen.c, strcat.c and intcat.c will display their contents as a text file.
Agrs: <fileToRead>

strrev.c and intrev.c take the files generated by strgen.c and intgen.c and reverse the order of the data 
in the files.
Args: <fileToReverse> <outFile>

strtoint.c takes the file generated by intgen.c and turns it into a file which can be read by 
strcat.c and strrev.c.
Args: <fileToConvert> <outFile>

All files were compiled using: gcc -Wall -m32 -O
